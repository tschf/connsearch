# SQLDev Connection Search

Search SQLDev connections. Currently tied to my personal installation.
Eventually, I am for this to be dynamic but for now, it's specific to my
environment. It also just lists all connections presently, along with the 
plain text password.

Disclaimer, I didn't do the research behind finding out how passwords in SQL
Developer are encrypted, and most likely won't investigate when things change 
in the software. This is just a little hobby project using other peoples wisdom 
to make it easier to connect to the database from the command line without 
having to store the  password in a secondary location to SQL Developer.

I didn't even bother with the version 3 version as per those sources.
